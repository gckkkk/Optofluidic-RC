# simple-optofluidic-based-XOR-test
'XOR_test.mlx' is the code containing everything from phase extraction to XOR training & testing
Other two files are small functions for the main code.

's50xx.mat' are input signals for each test.
Raw .ptw data (video) is too big to upload, so attached 'phase50xx_low.mat', 
which is the phase extracted from previous two steps,
so please drectly start from %%% talior phase vs time data %%% part
